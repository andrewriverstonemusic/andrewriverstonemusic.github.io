  <font size=4> <br> 
  Raised on the wild North Devon coast on sounds of Motown, glam rock
and roaring lions*,<br> Andrew Riverstone taught himself to play guitar
listening to 60s and 70s blues and progressive rock LPs.<P>

After a stint at art college he packed his guitar and suitcase, moved to London, quickly establishing <br>
himself as a versatile session musician. He recorded with producers Warne Livesey (Julian Cope, The The)<br>
Gus Dudgeon (Elton John, David Bowie, Chris Rea), John Burns (Genesis)<br>
and co-wrote with Busta Jones from Talking Heads, recording at Abbey Road studios.<P>

Riverstone followed footsteps of his heroes Peter Green and Jimi Hendrix
to perform at iconic London venues<br>
the Marquee, Goldsmiths College, Hammersmith Palais and Camden Electric Ballroom.<P>

He toured with Irish rock band 'Cast of Thousands' and played on the debut album 'Passion'. <br>
 Released on the Fun After All label, a subsidiary of Music for Nations,<br>
the LP sold 25,000 copies in the UK and Europe.<P>

Exploring a love of acoustic music Andrew launched his solo
career with the album 'Discovery'.<br> Building from acoustic guitar and vocal tracks
he enhanced the sound with<br> layers of world percussion and atmospheric instruments.<P>

Discovery was well received with extensive radio play for the opening track "Emily".<br>
This led to shows across the UK and many festival performances including three consecutive years<br>
at Glastonbury, where he performed for Spanish national radio and was filmed by MTV.<P>

A maturing writing style channelled into follow up album 'Forbidden Fruit', <br>
experimenting with electric and acoustic sounds over spacious drum loops.<P>

In the following years Andrew became involved with several electro/acoustic<br>
group projects, notably jazz/classical Indian fusion band Nada<br>
with saxophonist Tony Roberts, Bristol bands Mellostatics and Jampilot.<P>
 
His solo career refocused with the release of the 'Sunny Monday' album in 2016, returning to a more<br>
traditional roots & blues sound, and recording covers of songs by Bob Dylan, Robert Johnson and Cream.<P>

A seasoned live performer Andrew honed his skills with regular tours of UK clubs,<br>
pubs, art centres and festivals. Making imaginative use of a loop pedal to create a full sound,<br>
he's built a loyal following for dynamic and expressive solo shows.<P>

Riverstone's latest self-titled album mixes gritty blues riffs with African percussion and soulful vocals.<br>
Live favourite 'Sunny Monday' has been re-recorded in a driving blues/groove style,<br>
alongside a colourful array of new original songs with a harder, dirtier sound, <br>
reflecting the trials and tribulations of life in the early 21st century.<P>

The album has been very well received with favourable reviews in Blues Matters Magazine UK, Blues Blast USA,<br>
and extensive radio play worldwide. The LP is available via major download and streaming sites,<br>
and CD copies are available to purchase from this website via the shop page.<P>

Andrew is currently working on material for a 5th album.<P>

* Neigbours included a brown bear, barbary ape and a family of lions in the town zoo.
